## Colour scheme

![Colour scheme used](documentation/colours.png)

The choice of colors for a Halloween-themed website is crucial for creating the right atmosphere and enhancing the overall user experience. Here's an explanation for why the colors you've chosen are well-suited for a Halloween website:

#000 (Black):

![.](/favicon-16x16.png) Black is often associated with darkness, mystery, and the unknown, making it a perfect choice for Halloween.  
![.](/favicon-16x16.png) It represents the night, which is when many Halloween events and traditions take place, such as trick-or-treating and haunted houses.  
![.](/favicon-16x16.png) Black also creates a spooky and eerie backdrop, which sets the stage for the Halloween theme.

#ff6100 (Pumpkin Orange):

![.](/favicon-16x16.png) Orange is closely linked to Halloween because of pumpkins, a prominent symbol of the holiday. The bright orange color of pumpkins is iconic and evokes a festive, Halloween spirit.  
![.](/favicon-16x16.png) The use of a vibrant and energetic shade of orange, adds warmth and excitement to the design, reminiscent of the glowing jack-o'-lanterns that adorn Halloween celebrations.

#ff8c00 (Spooky Orange):

![.](/favicon-16x16.png) This slightly darker shade of orange adds depth and contrast to the design.  
![.](/favicon-16x16.png) It complements the pumpkin orange and adds a sense of warmth and energy while retaining a spooky and mysterious feel.

#39ff14 (Bright Green):

![.](/favicon-16x16.png) Bright green is reminiscent of eerie, supernatural elements often associated with Halloween, like witches, monsters, and eerie creatures.  
![.](/favicon-16x16.png) It contrasts well with the black background and creates a visual pop, making it an excellent choice for call-to-action buttons or highlights on the website.

#fff (White):

![.](/favicon-16x16.png) White serves as a striking contrast to the other darker colors and helps maintain readability, ensuring that text and content are easily visible.

## Imagery

The images used in the "Witchway Tracker" app are of paramount importance as they serve to visually engage and immerse users in the Halloween experience. High-quality and compelling images of Halloween events, costumes, and the overall atmosphere play a crucial role in capturing the essence of the holiday. These images help users preview and understand the events, locations, and activities available in Dublin during Halloween, making informed choices about which events to attend. Additionally, user-generated costume photos in the galleries foster a sense of community and inspire creativity among costume enthusiasts. The images set the tone, build anticipation, and enhance the overall user experience, making the app more inviting and exciting for all users, whether they are local residents, tourists, costume enthusiasts, or event organisers.

## Typography

Headings - [Creepster]():

![.](/favicon-16x16.png) Style: Creepy, spooky, and decorative.  
![.](/favicon-16x16.png) Use: Often used for Halloween-themed or horror-related content. Its distinctive style makes it suitable for headlines and titles in designs that require a playful or spooky aesthetic.

Body text - [Signika Negative]():

![.](/favicon-16x16.png) Style: Clean, modern, and highly readable.  
![.](/favicon-16x16.png) Use: A sans-serif font that's great for body text and general readability. It offers good legibility and is commonly used for paragraphs, articles, and other long-form text.

The combination of a decorative and playful font for headers (Creepster) with a clean and readable font for body text (Signika Negative) is a good choice, as it creates a contrast that enhances the overall design while maintaining readability and visual appeal.
